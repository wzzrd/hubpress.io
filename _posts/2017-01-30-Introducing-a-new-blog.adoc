= Introducing a new blog!
:hp-tags: Intro

With my recently launched Youtube channel - 100 things to do with Red Hat Management products - I felt that it would be useful to have a blog. A place where I could announce new videos, add some additional explanation to those videos, link to extra content, etc. 

To be honest, I'm not completely sure that I've found what I'm looking for with this Hubpress.io thingy, but it looks good enough for now.

I've been looking forward to this for quite a while, ever since it was announced: today, the first two episodes of Command Line Heroes were published. Command Line Heroes, or CLH for short, is a series of podcasts that tells the stories of open source. It's hosted by Saron Yitbarek, of CodeNewbie fame, and sponsored by Red Hat.

The podcast is not about how to create an alias in Bash, or how to generate a CSR with openssl. It is about the history of Linux, open source, devops and cloud.

If you're a geek, a hacker, a developer, a programmer, or any other sort of passionat open source builder, maker, or user, you'll definitely want to look into this.

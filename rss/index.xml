<h3 id="_intro">Intro</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this is a new blog on Fedora Planet, let me start off by introducing myself briefly. My name is Maxim Burgerhout, and I have been a Fedora contributor for quite some time. Truth be told though, I haven&#8217;t been able to spend much time maintaining my packages over the past couple of years. As a different way of giving back, I want to start sharing some experiences with open source software in a specific niche: screencast creation, and video editing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_background">Background</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A couple of months back, I started recording screencasts about Red Hat products.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. For now, it&#8217;s mostly about management products, like Satellite, Ansible Tower and things like that, but I&#8217;ll potentially also cover other products and projects as they pop up in my daily work, and as said above, I intend to start sharing some experiences.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup> about creating screencasts on Fedora.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming more people are trying to figure out the same things I am, I&#8217;m starting off with a short write-up of my experiences so far, trying to work with open source software to create screencasts. Spoiler: it&#8217;s not as easy as I hoped it would be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The below article is based on my experience using Fedora 25.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recording_video">Recording video</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ever since I started doing this, I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://screencastify.com/">Screencastify</a> as my screen recorder of choice. I have tried using the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/690/easyscreencast/">EasyScreencast</a> Gnome Shell extension in the beginning, but it had (temporarily) died, so that didn&#8217;t seem viable. It seems to have revived though, so I&#8217;ll probably try it again when my Screencastify subscription expires near the end of the calendar year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also tried the <a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en">CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-R</a> option to start a screencast recording in Gnome, but that records both my monitors, which makes editing the whole thing into a Youtube video quite a pain.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, gtk-recordmydesktop gives me all kinds of strange artifacts in my recording when I move my mouse. It also seemed to crash quite frequently, and seems to be dead upstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All options available from the community (the built-in one, gtk-recordmydesktop and EasyScreencast) were disqualified for various reasons, either because of lack of maintenance, quircks or instability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, apart from the occasional crash (which happens very seldomly), Screencastify works beautifully. I can record a window, a Chrome tab, or my whole desktop. Recording my voice over the videos also works pretty well, using a USB microphone I bought for the purpose of creating screencasts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside of Screencastify is that it&#8217;s a proprietary piece of software. For now, it&#8217;s the clear winner, but in the future I&#8217;ll give EasyScreencast a go for it&#8217;s money again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recording_audio_on_it_s_own">Recording audio on it&#8217;s own</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recording audio on Fedora can be done through various options, of which the two most obvious are <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Apps/SoundRecorder">Sound Recorder</a> and <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sound Recorder is the default sound recorder app in Gnome 3. It&#8217;s OK for very simple usage, but the moment you want to start editing audio or improving audio quality using filters, Sound Recorder doesn&#8217;t offer anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Audacity on the contrary, is <strong>very</strong> complete. It&#8217;s even a bit intimidating in the amount of options it offers, but in terms of recording quality, editing the recordings and improving their quality, Audacity is the de-facto standard in open source, on Linux as well as on various other platforms. Simply said, it&#8217;s brilliant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Audacity is the clear winner hear, without any real competition.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_editing_video">Editing video</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So this is where the real pain starts. Save to say, video editing on Linux was a bit of a disappointment for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have tried all of the major video editing open source projects that available natively on Fedora: Kdenlive, Pitivi, Avidemux and OpenShot, as well as the commercially available Lightworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To start with <a href="http://fixounet.free.fr/avidemux/">Avidemux</a>: it seems to lack the full broad spectrum of features one would need to edit and merge large amounts of clips into a new video, and insert transitions and background audio. I assume it would work nicely to just crop two videos and slam them together, but it doesn&#8217;t feel right for more complex things. Granted, I haven&#8217;t spent a huge amount with this program, so let me know if you think I&#8217;m dismissing Avidemux too easily. It just wasn&#8217;t enough for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next up are <a href="http://www.openshot.org/">OpenShot</a> and <a href="https://kdenlive.org/">Kdenlive</a>. Both great programs, both with extensive feature sets that would suffice for me and both with the same continuous problem that disqualified them: they crash. Over and over. I&#8217;ll be filing bugs for both, but no matter how that turns out, right NOW, they are not very useful for me. Both seem to have somewhat lively upstreams tho, so who knows what the future might bring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sadly, I&#8217;ve spent too much time trying to get OpenShoft and Kdenlive to work, and that kept me from thoroughly evaluating my next contender: <a href="http://www.pitivi.org/">Pitivi</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pitivi used to fall into the same category as OpenShoft and Kdenlive (crashing), but I haven&#8217;t experienced any crashes recently. I comes with a nice set of effects, just like OpenShoft and Kdenlive, and is fairly easy to use. It exports to all of the right formats, but sadly, rendering of video happens in the foreground. This blocksyou from using the program during that process. Not a big deal for a video of a couple of minutes, but annoying for anything longer than that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final program I just had to take a look at, is Lightworks. It&#8217;s not open source, but it really is bloody good. It&#8217;s by far the most complete of the lot, but it comes at a hefty price. Also, some of the options that are really interesting for making screencasts, like a built-in voice-over recorder, isn&#8217;t available on Linux :(</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I would say for video editing, Pitivi and Lightworks are tied, with Lightworks being the more complete option, and Pitivi being the open source one.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Audio editing we have under control in open source. Audacity is great. It&#8217;s just really, really great. (There, enough Trumpianisms for today.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Screencast recording has come a long way, but hasn&#8217;t quite reached the level of functionality I needed a couple of months back. It might have grown to that level in the meantime, though. I&#8217;ll take the time to re-evaluate EasyScreencast and post an update sometime in the Fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Video editing is still a bit of a problem. The commercial option is good, but pretty expensive and obviously not open source. Two of the three main contenders (OpenShot and Kdenlive) have serious stability issues, up to the point that I just gave up on them. Bugs will be filed, but that&#8217;s not helping me today. Pitivi is a little less complete than both OpenShot and Kdenlive, I think, but does show promise (and doesn&#8217;t crash that often).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with EasyScreencast, I&#8217;ll give Pitivi as second try and hopefully find an open source solution for my video editing problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TL;DR if you are looking for a set of tools to record and edit screencasts on Fedora, you probably want to check out EasyScreencast, and use Screencastify as a fall-back option. For audio, there&#8217;s no way around Audacity. If you can shell out some dough and don&#8217;t mind a bit of proprietary software, go for Lightworks, otherwise Pitivi will help you overcome most video editing problems.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So last Tuesday, I presented about Red Hat&#8217;s container development kit during the Red Hat Tech Day in Utrecht (NL).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though most of the demos succeeded eventually, they all took way longer than expected due to some network issues. I&#8217;ll be frank: that sucked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I tried to make good on my promise to make sure everyone would be able to see these demos at their own time and pace. This morning I did some recording, I did some editing and I did some publishing. And as of now, all five demos that I planned to do are available on my YouTube channel, and you&#8217;ll find direct links to them below for convenience. There&#8217;s also a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTJ5vj7osiGO7K70076Y4kjWgoQxfKyJd">playlist</a> on youtube.com that has all five videos in them. For binge watching ;)</p>

<p>With the release of Ansible Tower 3.1 a short while back, it became possible to setup Ansible Tower in a highly available, active-active topology. You do this by setting up multiple Tower nodes that talk to a shared PostgreSQL database on a separate node. This database can be setup and managed by the Tower installation playbook, or you can manage it yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of the Tower nodes will serve up the web front end, so your users can choose which Tower server they use to log into. If you change the configuration through the web UI on one node, the change is visible over all instances through the shared database. For example, uploading a Tower license file to one of the Tower instances will make it show up in all of your Tower cluster nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cluster nodes keep in touch with one another for job scheduling and such through RabbitMQ.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sounds good? That&#8217;s because it is! And it gets better: setting up a Tower cluster is insanely easy!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, I have set up a Tower cluster on three nodes: tower01.nontoonyt.lan, tower02.nontoonyt.lan and tower03.nontoonyt.lan. The database will reside on towerdb.nontoonyt.lan. By configuring the inventory in a specific - and quite simple - way, the Tower installation playbooks will build the whole cluster for me.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The below snippet is an edited version of the special inventory file we ship in the ansible-tower-setup tarball, called "inventory_cluster".</p>

<p>After I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04m6SlvzvKY&amp;list=PLTJ5vj7osiGMHEi9SQvoyXD2vNL_v8WFv">presented at Summit</a> last Summer, I starting getting frequent questions around how to setup a dedicated Puppet content view in Satellite 6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a dedicated Puppet content view can be useful for your organization if you are doing intensive development on your Puppet code base. This usually applies to organizations that are just getting started implementing Puppet: you are making many changes to the Puppet code base all the time, and if you stick those modules in a CV with 35,000 RPMs in there as well, publishing a new version will take more time than  you probably want to spend waiting. (Apologies for the long sentence there.)</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wzzrd/hubpress.io/gh-pages/images/pupcvs.png" alt="a Puppet CV created" width="480" height="270">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you split out your Puppet modules into a dedicated content view, you get quick publishing and promotion of that content view, speeding up the pace of making changes to your Puppet code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside is, that you are breaking the bond between RPMs and Puppet content views. This means that you can no longer be sure that a specific version of a content view with RPMs is tested with a certain set of Puppet modules. How important that is for your infrastructure, I cannot assess, but I have learned it varies from customer to customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I created another screencast to explain the concept of a dedicated Puppet content view, uploaded it to Youtube and I hope you enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Please make sure you subscribe to the channel and leave comments and / or like the video. Your feedback is important to me and makes it clear whether or not I&#8217;m helping people by making these videos.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next time around, I&#8217;ll start introducing other Red Hat management products, starting with Ansible Tower.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until then! Cheers!</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wzzrd/hubpress.io/gh-pages/images/boxes.png" alt="Whiteboarding" width="480" height="270">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have been talking about content views in the previous posts, but to be sure we are all on the same page: a content view is a versioned, filtered set of repositories that you can promote between lifecycle environments. We have been talking about 'normal' content views, or CV, up until now, but Satellite 6 also knows the concept of a <em>composite content view</em>, or CCV.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A composite content view allows you to bundle other content views, rather than individual repositories. The best approach to this is to start creating re-usable building blocks (component content views) to bundle in CCVs. You could, for example, create a building block for the base operating system, and combine that with different application content views into composite content views.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might want to do this if your application content views follow different lifecycle paths, or move slower (or faster) than your base operating system content view through the same lifecycle path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another use case would be if the application content view is maintained by a different department. By using composite content views in that case, the team of application administrators or developers can manage the application content view, and the Linux administrator team can manage the base operating system content view. Every once in a while - depending on requirements - the two component CVs are bundled together into a CCV, and then published and promoted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You then use activation keys to register new systems to the CCV and use the provisions in that activation key to grant access to specific repositories in the CCV. (This will be the topic of a later video.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I created this episode because people often ask what the difference is between CVs and CCVs, and if they should always use CCVs. I want to be clear about that last question. The answer to it is a distinct <em>no</em>. Do <em>not</em> use CCVs just because you can. <em>Do</em> use CCVs because you are trying to solve one of the use cases mentioned above, or one of the use cases mentioned in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/1585273">10 Steps to Build an SOE with Satellite 6</a> document. For those cases, CCVs are perfect :)</p>

<p>The other day, I was talking to a customer about Satellite updates regarding the recently released <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/1169563/posts/2890071">Satellite 6.2.7 update</a>. He and his co-workers were a little anxious about updating their Satellite server, as it is a quite vital piece of their infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I explained the simple upgrade procedure and as they ran through it, they quickly saw that everything went smoothly. Within a couple of minutes they were running on a new versin of Satellite! :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It then occured to me though, that it would make sense to pause the video series about content views for a bit. Instead of a content view video, I&#8217;m doing an extra video on the simple steps of safely and correctly updating a Satellite server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a really short one - as I hope to have more - that walks you quickly through the steps of updating a Satellite 6 system:</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identifying that there is an update outstanding (always read the documentation about released updates!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>backup your Satellite server (this is a step I do not show in the video, for obvious reasons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>installing the updated packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making sure any database migrations and mandatory configuration file changes are applied</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The video below will take you through these steps and make sure you are prepared for your next Satellite 6 update! :) Please subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6AybwWpjM2-JCBk-63w5iQ">Youtube channel</a> to be informed of future videos!</p>

<p>With my recently launched Youtube channel - 100 things to do with Red Hat Management products - I felt that it would be useful to have a blog. A place where I could announce new videos, add some additional explanation to those videos, link to extra content, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not completely sure that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m looking for with this Hubpress.io thingy, but it looks good enough for now.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s video is about advanced content filtering in Satellite 6. As you probably know, Satellite 6 allows you to filter any repositories it serves out to your clients. These filtered repositories we call 'content views'. If you are unfamiliar with that, I suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp4LqBpaKg">last week&#8217;s video</a>, that introduces content views and some related concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are ready for a deeper dive into content filtering, then this week&#8217;s video is exactly right for you! As a short preview, this week, I&#8217;m talking about:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the difference between include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it makes sense to combine include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it does not,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>filtering errata vs. filtering packages</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

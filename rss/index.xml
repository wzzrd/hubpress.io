<p>After I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04m6SlvzvKY&amp;list=PLTJ5vj7osiGMHEi9SQvoyXD2vNL_v8WFv">presented at Summit</a> last Summer, I starting getting frequent questions around how to setup a dedicated Puppet content view in Satellite 6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using a dedicated Puppet content view can be useful for your organization if you are doing intensive development on your Puppet code base. This usually applies to organizations that are just getting started implementing Puppet: you are making many changes to the Puppet code base all the time, and if you stick those modules in a CV with 35,000 RPMs in there as well, publishing a new version will take more time than  you probably want to spend waiting. (Apologies for the long sentence there.)</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you split out your Puppet modules into a dedicated content view, you get quick publishing and promotion of that content view, speeding up the pace of making changes to your Puppet code base.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside is, that you are breaking the bond between RPMs and Puppet content views. This means that you can no longer be sure that a specific version of a content view with RPMs is tested with a certain set of Puppet modules. How important that is for your infrastructure, I cannot assess, but I have learned it varies from customer to customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyway, I created another screencast to explain the concept of a dedicated Puppet content view, uploaded it to Youtube and I hope you enjoy.</p>

<p>Next time around, I&#8217;ll start introducing other Red Hat management products, starting with Ansible Tower.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Until then! Cheers!</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have been talking about content views in the previous posts, but to be sure we are all on the same page: a content view is a versioned, filtered set of repositories that you can promote between lifecycle environments. We have been talking about 'normal' content views, or CV, up until now, but Satellite 6 also knows the concept of a <em>composite content view</em>, or CCV.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A composite content view allows you to bundle other content views, rather than individual repositories. The best approach to this is to start creating re-usable building blocks (component content views) to bundle in CCVs. You could, for example, create a building block for the base operating system, and combine that with different application content views into composite content views.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might want to do this if your application content views follow different lifecycle paths, or move slower (or faster) than your base operating system content view through the same lifecycle path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another use case would be if the application content view is maintained by a different department. By using composite content views in that case, the team of application administrators or developers can manage the application content view, and the Linux administrator team can manage the base operating system content view. Every once in a while - depending on requirements - the two component CVs are bundled together into a CCV, and then published and promoted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You then use activation keys to register new systems to the CCV and use the provisions in that activation key to grant access to specific repositories in the CCV. (This will be the topic of a later video.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I created this episode because people often ask what the difference is between CVs and CCVs, and if they should always use CCVs. I want to be clear about that last question. The answer to it is a distinct <em>no</em>. Do <em>not</em> use CCVs just because you can. <em>Do</em> use CCVs because you are trying to solve one of the use cases mentioned above, or one of the use cases mentioned in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/1585273">10 Steps to Build an SOE with Satellite 6</a> document. For those cases, CCVs are perfect :)</p>

<p>The other day, I was talking to a customer about Satellite updates regarding the recently released <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/1169563/posts/2890071">Satellite 6.2.7 update</a>. He and his co-workers were a little anxious about updating their Satellite server, as it is a quite vital piece of their infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I explained the simple upgrade procedure and as they ran through it, they quickly saw that everything went smoothly. Within a couple of minutes they were running on a new versin of Satellite! :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It then occured to me though, that it would make sense to pause the video series about content views for a bit. Instead of a content view video, I&#8217;m doing an extra video on the simple steps of safely and correctly updating a Satellite server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a really short one - as I hope to have more - that walks you quickly through the steps of updating a Satellite 6 system:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identifying that there is an update outstanding (always read the documentation about released updates!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>backup your Satellite server (this is a step I do not show in the video, for obvious reasons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>installing the updated packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making sure any database migrations and mandatory configuration file changes are applied</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The video below will take you through these steps and make sure you are prepared for your next Satellite 6 update! :) Please subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6AybwWpjM2-JCBk-63w5iQ">Youtube channel</a> to be informed of future videos!</p>

<p>With my recently launched Youtube channel - 100 things to do with Red Hat Management products - I felt that it would be useful to have a blog. A place where I could announce new videos, add some additional explanation to those videos, link to extra content, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not completely sure that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m looking for with this Hubpress.io thingy, but it looks good enough for now.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s video is about advanced content filtering in Satellite 6. As you probably know, Satellite 6 allows you to filter any repositories it serves out to your clients. These filtered repositories we call 'content views'. If you are unfamiliar with that, I suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp4LqBpaKg">last week&#8217;s video</a>, that introduces content views and some related concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are ready for a deeper dive into content filtering, then this week&#8217;s video is exactly right for you! As a short preview, this week, I&#8217;m talking about:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the difference between include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it makes sense to combine include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it does not,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>filtering errata vs. filtering packages</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The other day, I was talking to a customer about Satellite updates regarding the recently released <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/1169563/posts/2890071">Satellite 6.2.7 update</a>. He and his co-workers were a little anxious about updating their Satellite server, as it is a quite vital piece of their infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I explained the simple upgrade procedure and as they ran through it, they quickly saw that everything went smoothly. Within a couple of minutes they were running on a new versin of Satellite! :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It then occured to me though, that it would make sense to pause the video series about content views for a bit. Instead of a content view video, I&#8217;m doing an extra video on the simple steps of safely and correctly updating a Satellite server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a really short one - as I hope to have more - that walks you quickly through the steps of updating a Satellite 6 system:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identifying that there is an update outstanding (always read the documentation about released updates!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>installing the updated packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making sure any database migrations and mandatory configuration file changes are applied</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The video below will take you through these steps and make sure you are prepared for your next Satellite 6 update! :) Please subscribe to the Youtube channel to be informed of future videos!</p>

<p>With my recently launched Youtube channel - 100 things to do with Red Hat Management products - I felt that it would be useful to have a blog. A place where I could announce new videos, add some additional explanation to those videos, link to extra content, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not completely sure that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m looking for with this Hubpress.io thingy, but it looks good enough for now.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s video is about advanced content filtering in Satellite 6. As you probably know, Satellite 6 allows you to filter any repositories it serves out to your clients. These filtered repositories we call 'content views'. If you are unfamiliar with that, I suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp4LqBpaKg">last week&#8217;s video</a>, that introduces content views and some related concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are ready for a deeper dive into content filtering, then this week&#8217;s video is exactly right for you! As a short preview, this week, I&#8217;m talking about:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the difference between include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it makes sense to combine include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it does not,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>filtering errata vs. filtering packages</p>
</li>
</ul>

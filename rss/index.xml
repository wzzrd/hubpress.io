<p>We have been talking about content views in the previous posts, but to be sure we are all on the same page: a content view is a versioned, filtered set of repositories that you can promote between lifecycle environments. We have been talking about 'normal' content views up until now, but Satellite 6 also knows the concept of a composite content view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A composite content view allows you to bundle other content views, rather than individual repositories. By using composite content views to attach to your systems, you can create re-usable building blocks. You could, for example, create a building block (a component content view) for the base operating system, and combine those  different application content views into composite content views. You might want to do this if your application content views follow different lifecycle paths, or move slower (or faster) than your base operating system content view through the same lifecycle path.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another use case would be if the application content view is maintained by a different department. By using composite content views in that case, the team application administrators or developers can manage the application content view, and the Linux admin team can manage the base operating system content view. Every once in a while - depending on requirements - the two component CVs are bundled together into a CCV, published and promoted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You then use activation keys to register new systems to the CCV and use the provisions in that activation key to grant access to specific repositories in the CCV.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I created this episode because people often ask what the difference is between CVs and CCVs and if they should always use CCVs. The answer to that last question is 'no'. Do <strong>not</strong> use CCVs just because you can. Use CCVs because you are trying to solve one of the use cases mentioned above, or one of the use cases mentioned in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/1585273">10 Steps to Build an SOE with Satellite 6</a> document. For those cases, CCVs are perfect :)</p>

<p>The other day, I was talking to a customer about Satellite updates regarding the recently released <a href="https://access.redhat.com/blogs/1169563/posts/2890071">Satellite 6.2.7 update</a>. He and his co-workers were a little anxious about updating their Satellite server, as it is a quite vital piece of their infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I explained the simple upgrade procedure and as they ran through it, they quickly saw that everything went smoothly. Within a couple of minutes they were running on a new versin of Satellite! :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It then occured to me though, that it would make sense to pause the video series about content views for a bit. Instead of a content view video, I&#8217;m doing an extra video on the simple steps of safely and correctly updating a Satellite server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a really short one - as I hope to have more - that walks you quickly through the steps of updating a Satellite 6 system:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>identifying that there is an update outstanding (always read the documentation about released updates!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>backup your Satellite server (this is a step I do not show in the video, for obvious reasons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>installing the updated packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>making sure any database migrations and mandatory configuration file changes are applied</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The video below will take you through these steps and make sure you are prepared for your next Satellite 6 update! :) Please subscribe to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6AybwWpjM2-JCBk-63w5iQ">Youtube channel</a> to be informed of future videos!</p>

<p>With my recently launched Youtube channel - 100 things to do with Red Hat Management products - I felt that it would be useful to have a blog. A place where I could announce new videos, add some additional explanation to those videos, link to extra content, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m not completely sure that I&#8217;ve found what I&#8217;m looking for with this Hubpress.io thingy, but it looks good enough for now.</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s video is about advanced content filtering in Satellite 6. As you probably know, Satellite 6 allows you to filter any repositories it serves out to your clients. These filtered repositories we call 'content views'. If you are unfamiliar with that, I suggest you go take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQp4LqBpaKg">last week&#8217;s video</a>, that introduces content views and some related concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are ready for a deeper dive into content filtering, then this week&#8217;s video is exactly right for you! As a short preview, this week, I&#8217;m talking about:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the difference between include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it makes sense to combine include and exclude filters,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in what cases it does not,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>filtering errata vs. filtering packages</p>
</li>
</ul>
